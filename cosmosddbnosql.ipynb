Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Cosmos Client**: It starts by creating a [`CosmosClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fazure%2Fcosmos%2Fcosmos_client.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/azure/cosmos/cosmos_client.py\") object using a [`HOST`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A27%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\") and a dictionary containing a `masterKey` as [`MASTER_KEY`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A28%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\"). This client is used to interact with the Azure Cosmos DB service.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Get Database Client**: The function then retrieves a client for the specific database ([`dbsource`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A42%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\")) using the [`get_database_client`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fazure%2Fcosmos%2Fcosmos_client.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A365%2C%22character%22%3A8%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/azure/cosmos/cosmos_client.py\") method of the [`CosmosClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fazure%2Fcosmos%2Fcosmos_client.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/azure/cosmos/cosmos_client.py\") object.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Print Collection Name**: It prints the name of the collection (container) to be created or ensured exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Define Vector Embedding Policy**: A dictionary named [`vector_embedding_policy`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W4sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A7%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\") is defined, specifying the settings for vector embeddings. This includes the path (`/embedding`), data type (`float32`), distance function (`cosine`), and dimensions (`1536`) of the embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Define Indexing Policy**: Another dictionary, [`indexing_policy`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W4sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A8%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\"), is defined to specify which paths are included and excluded in the indexing, as well as the vector indexes configuration. It includes all paths (`/*`) except the `_etag` path and specifies a vector index on the `/embedding` path with a type of `quantizedFlat`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create or Ensure Container Exists**: The function attempts to create a container (or ensure it exists) in the database client ([`mydbt`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W4sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A3%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\")) with the specified `id` (collection name), partition key (on the `/id` path), offer throughput settings (with auto-scaling up to 1000 throughput units), and the previously defined indexing and vector embedding policies. If the container is successfully created or confirmed to exist, it prints \"container created\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Error Handling**: If an error occurs during the container creation process, the function will raise the caught exception to be handled by the caller.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is tailored for scenarios where there's a need to store and efficiently query large sets of vector data in Azure Cosmos DB, leveraging Cosmos DB's capabilities for NoSQL data storage and advanced indexing features like vector indexing for AI and machine learning applications."

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of its functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize Cosmos Client**: It starts by creating a [`CosmosClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fazure%2Fcosmos%2Fcosmos_client.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/azure/cosmos/cosmos_client.py\") instance using a [`HOST`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22W2sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A27%2C%22character%22%3A0%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\") and a dictionary containing a `masterKey` (presumably for authentication). This client is used to interact with the Cosmos DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Get Database Client**: The function then retrieves a client for the specified database ([`db`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22X10sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A16%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\")) using the [`CosmosClient`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Fazure%2Fcosmos%2Fcosmos_client.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A141%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/azure/cosmos/cosmos_client.py\") instance.\n",

The loaded data is assumed to be text extracted from the PDF.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Split Text Data**: The text data is then split into smaller documents using a [`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2F.venv%2FLib%2Fsite-packages%2Flangchain_text_splitters%2Fcharacter.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A57%2C%22character%22%3A6%7D%5D \".venv/Lib/site-packages/langchain_text_splitters/character.py\"), which likely breaks the text into chunks of 1000 characters with an overlap of 150 characters between chunks. This is useful for processing large texts or for fitting into database constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Print First Document**: It prints the first document chunk to the console, likely for debugging or verification purposes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Create or Get Container**: The function attempts to create a new container in the database if it doesn't exist. The container is identified by [`collection`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22X10sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A19%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\"), uses `/id` as the partition key, and is configured with auto-scalable throughput properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Insert Documents into Container**: For each document chunk created earlier, it generates a new document with a unique `id` (using [`uuid4`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FLib%2Fuuid.py%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A722%2C%22character%22%3A4%7D%5D \"../../Lib/uuid.py\")), the original [`file`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%7B%22%24mid%22%3A1%2C%22fsPath%22%3A%22c%3A%5C%5CUsers%5C%5Cedeletang%5C%5CDocuments%5C%5Cdemonosqlcomsosdb%5C%5Ccosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22_sep%22%3A1%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fc%3A%2FUsers%2Fedeletang%2FDocuments%2Fdemonosqlcomsosdb%2Fcosmosddbnosql.ipynb%22%2C%22scheme%22%3A%22vscode-notebook-cell%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22X10sZmlsZQ%3D%3D%22%7D%2C%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A35%7D%5D \"c:\\Users\\edeletang\\Documents\\demonosqlcomsosdb\\cosmosddbnosql.ipynb\") name, and the chunked `text`. Each document is then upserted into the container. Upserting means that the document will be inserted if it doesn't exist or updated if it does.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Error Handling**: The insertion process is wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential errors gracefully. If an error occurs, it raises an exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Count Documents**: After inserting the documents, it attempts to count the total number of documents in the container using a SQL query. The total count is printed to the console.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Error Handling for Counting**: The counting process is also wrapped in a try-except block to handle potential errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "This function is designed to process and store large text data from PDF files into Cosmos DB, making the data queryable and manageable. It includes basic error handling and prints out useful information for debugging."

Each document is then upserted into the Cosmos DB container, meaning it will be inserted if it doesn't exist or updated if it does.\n",
